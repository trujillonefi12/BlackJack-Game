# BlackJack-Game
This was part of my projects in my second semester in my Object Oriented Programming Class (CS115)

This project includes many object oriented basic skills, such as creation of Abstract Classes, Implemententation and extensions
of different methods, polymorphism, inheritance, and many other use of different skills in methods and all types of 
collections in JAVA.
It was a very fun project to do and I learned a lot, specially developing logic to the thigns I create.
